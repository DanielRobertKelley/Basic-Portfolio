        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Daniel I am 29 and currently attending a coding boot camp at Case Western Reserve University.
             I recent got into coding over the past year as a side hobby, and just made the decion to go back into school to follow it.
            I hope to gain enough skills in this class to be able to land a job doing front end work at a company. 
        My past experience working with start ups I would like to somehow get back into that industry. </p>
