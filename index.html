        <p> My name is Daniel Kelley, I am 29 and currently attending a coding boot camp at Case Western Reserve University. I currently do Marketing for a wholesale comany based out of Solon, Ohio.
            Over the past year I decided to start learning code in my spare time as a hobby. My goal during this class is to gain enough skill to land a front end developers job at a start up comany. 
             My time spent working at JumpStart I learned how to help young companies grow through online marketing, and I would love to get back into doing that.

                 I am a die hard Cleveland sports fan and can't wait for the day the Browns are back on top. I know I may still have to wait a while for this to happen, but I will never give up on them.
             To this day I still enjoy playing sports, and still participate in many leagues. Music is a love of mine and I try to attend as many concerts as I can. </p>
